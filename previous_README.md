# Études for ClojureScript

Exercises for the beginning ClojureScript programmer.

## Overview

In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can compose (write) in ClojureScript. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular ClojureScript programming concept. Unlike musical études, these programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in most ClojureScript books or online references.
