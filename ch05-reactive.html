<h1>Reactive Programming</h1>

<p>
Reactive programming is a way of programming that lets you specify how data flows through user interface components; once this is set up, the DOM updating is handled for you automagically. (As noted in <a href="#chapter02" data-type="xref">#chapter02</a>, this is what all the Cool Kids<sup>&#8482;</sup> are using.)
<em>Insert further verbiage about the wonderfulness of reactive programming</em>
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, you will write études that use different ClojureScript libraries that interface with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">Facebook&#174;’s React JavaScript library</a>. <a href="http://blog.peeja.com/blog/2014/10/01/react-four-ways-how-to-use-react-in-clojurescript/">This blog post</a> gives you a comparison of the libraries. The two we will use are <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a> and <a href="http://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a>
</p>

<p>
These études will implement the same web page: a page that displays an image and lets you adjust its width, height, and (via CSS) its border width and style. In both libraries, you will build <em>components</em>, which are functions that, as the Quiescent documentation puts it, tell “how a particular piece of data should be rendered to the DOM.” Since they are functions, they can use all of ClojureScript’s computational power.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
The HTML for the page will include a <code>&lt;div&#160;id="interface"&gt;</code>, which is where the components will go.
</p>

<p>
Both versions of this étude will declare an <code>atom</code> (with a slight variation for Reagant) to hold the state of the the application in a map. Let’s do a quick review of atoms by defining an atom with a single value:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">(def quantity (atom 32))
cljs.user=&gt; #&lt;Atom:32&gt;</pre>

<p>
To access the data in an atom, you must dereference it with the `@` operator:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">cljs.user=&gt;@quantity
32</pre>

<p>
To update an atom’s data, use the <code><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/swap!">swap!</a></code> function (for individual map values) and <code>reset!</code> (for the entire value of the atom).  The <code>swap!</code> function takes as its
arguments:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the atom to be modified</li>
  <li>A function to apply to the atom</li>
  <li>The arguments to that function (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, in the REPL:
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">cljs.user=&gt; (swap! quantity inc)
33
cljs.user=&gt; (swap! quantity * 2)
66
cljs.user=&gt; (reset! quantity 47)
47
cljs.user=&gt; quantity
#&lt;Atom: 47&gt;
cljs.user=&gt; @quantity
47</pre>

<p>
However, in most ClojureScript programs, you do not create an atom for each part of the state you need to save. Instead, you will most often use a map.
</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">cljs.user=&gt; (def inventory (atom {:quantity 32 :price 3.75}))
#&lt;Atom: {:quantity 32, :price 3.75}&gt;
cljs.user=&gt; (swap! inventory assoc :price 4.22)
{:quantity 32, :price 4.22}
cljs.user=&gt; (swap! inventory assoc :quantity (inc (:quantity @inventory)))
{:quantity 33, :price 4.22}
cljs.user=&gt; @inventory
{:quantity 33, :price 4.22}</pre>

<p>
Back to the program for this étude. The page has to keep track of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The image’s current width and height</li>
  <li>Whether you want the width and height to stay in proportion or not</li>
  <li>The border width and style (intially three pixels solid)&#8212;the color will be set to red for visibility</li>
  <li>The image’s original width and height (needed to do proportional scaling properly)</li>
  <li>The image file name</li>
</ul>

<p>That gives us this atom.</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defonce status
         (atom {:w 0 :h 0 :proportional true
                :border-width 3 :border-style "solid"
                :orig-w 0 :orig-h 0 :src "clock.jpg"}))</pre>

  <h1>Étude 5-1: Reactive Programming with Quiescent</h1>
  <p>
  To use Quiescent, add  <code>[quiescent "0.2.0-alpha1"]</code> to your project’s dependencies and add requirements to your namespace: 
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(:require [quiescent.core :as q]
  [quiescent.dom :as d])</pre>
  
  <p>
  As an example, let’s define a simple component that displays an input area and some text that goes with the <code>w</code> field in the atom that was defined previously.
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(q/defcomponent Example
  :name "Example"
  [status]
  (d/div {}
    "Your input here: "
    (d/input {:type "text"
              :value (:w status)
              :size "5"})
    (d/br)
    "Your input, squared: "
    (d/span {} (* (:w status) (:w status)))))</pre>
 
  <p>
  The general format for creating an HTML element inside a component is to give its element name, a map of its attributes (or the empty map <code>{}</code> if there are no attributes, as on the <code>div</code>), and the element content, which may contain other elements. The <code>:name</code> before the parameter list gives the component a name for React to use. The key/value pairs before the parameter list make up the component configuration; this is described in detail <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent/blob/release/docs.md">in the Quiescent Documentation</a>. The value of the input field and <code>span</code> are provided by the current value of the <code>:w</code> key in the <code>status</code> atom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The only thing remaining to do is to render the component. In Quiescent, the <code>q/render</code> function renders a component once. If you want continuous rendering, you can use JavaScript’s <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to repeat the process. Remember, when using React, only the components that have changed get re-rendered, so you don’t need to worry about that using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> will eat your CPU alive.
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn render
  "Render the current state atom, and schedule a render on the next frame"
  []
  (q/render (Example @status) (aget (.getElementsByTagName js/document "body") 0))
  (.requestAnimationFrame js/window render))
  
  (render)</pre>
  
  <p>
  Quiescent’s <code>render</code> function takes two arguments: A call to the component with its argument&#8212;in this case, the de-referenced atom, and the DOM node where you want the component rooted. For this example, that’s the first (and, we hope, only) <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you compile this code and then load the <em>index.html</em> file, you will see a zero in the input and output area - but you will also find that you cannot type into the field. That is because Quiescent and React always keep the DOM value and the atom value synchronized, and since the value in the atom never changes, neither can the field. To fix that, add this code to the input element (it is in bold):
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(d/input {:type "text"
        :value (:w status)
        <strong>:onChange update-value</strong>
        :size "5"})</pre>

  <p>
  And then write the <code>update-value</code> function, which takes the value from the event target and puts it into the atom that keeps the page’s state.
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn update-value [evt]
  (swap! status assoc :w (.-value (.-target evt))))</pre>
  
  <p>
  Voilà&#8212;your page now updates properly.
  </p>

      <ol>
      <li><p>You will have to initialize the values for the image’s original width and height. To do this, you add an <code>:onLoad</code> clause to the properties of the image component. Its value is a function that handles the event by setting the width, height, original width, and original height. Use the <code>naturalWidth</code> and <code>naturalHeight</code> properties of the image. Those properties do not work with Internet Explorer 8, but will work in Intenet Explorer 9+.

      Here is an example of <code>:on-mount</code> to initialize the example’s input field to the current minute of the hour. <code>:on-mount</code> is followed by the definition of a function that has the current node as its argument.

  <h1>Étude 5-2: Reactive Programming with Reagent</h1>
  <p>
  To use Reagent, add  <code>[reagent "0.5.0"]</code> to your project’s dependencies and add this requirement to your namespace: 
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(:require [reagent.core :as reagent :refer [atom])</pre>
  
  <p>
  Note the <code>:refer [atom]</code> clause; Reagent has its own definition of <code>atom</code> that plays nicely with React; it is defined so that you can use it exactly the way you would use a normal ClojureScript atom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As an example, let’s define a simple component that displays an input area and some text that goes with the <code>w</code> field in the atom that was defined previously.
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn example []
 [:div
  "Your input here:"
  [:input {:type "text"
           :value (:w @status)
           :size "5"}]
  [:br]
  "Your input, squared: "
  [:span (* (:w @status) (:w @status))]])</pre>
 
  <p>
  The general format for creating an HTML element inside a component is to create a vector whose first element is a keyword giving the HTML element name, a map of its attributes (if any), and the element content, which may contain other elements. The value of the input field and <code>span</code> are provided by the current value of the <code>:w</code> key in the <code>status</code> atom. Unlike Quiescent, you must dereference the atom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The only thing remaining to do is to render the component. You don’t have to request animation frames; Reagent handles that for you.
  </p>
  
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn run []
  (reagent/render [example]
                  (aget (.getElementsByTagName js/document "body") 0)))
          
(run)
</pre>
  
  <p>
  Reagent’s <code>render</code> function takes two arguments: A call to the component and the DOM node where you want the component rooted. In this case, the first (and, we hope, only) <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you compile this code and then load the <em>index.html</em> file, you will see a zero in the input and output area - but you will also find that you cannot type into the field.

  <p>
  And then write the <code>update-value</code> function, which takes the value from the event target and puts it into the atom that keeps the page’s state.

      <p>
      Initializing the checkbox takes a bit more work in Reagent. You must define a symbol that adds meta-information to the <code>example</code> component. This information includes a function that does the initialization. Here is an example that initializes the example’s input field to the current minute of the hour. You then render the new component:
      </p>

  <h1>>Étude 5-2: Reactive Programming with Om</h1>
  <p>
    Om is much closer to React than Quiescent is. To use Om, add  <code>[org.omcljs/om "0.8.8"]</code> to your project’s dependencies and add requirements to your namespace: 
  </p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(:require [om.core :as om]
            [om.dom :as dom])</pre>

    <p>
  As an example, let’s define a simple component that displays an input area and some text that goes with the <code>w</code> field in the atom that was defined previously. In the following code, <code>data</code> refers to a <em>cursor</em>, which is a path to the part of the application state that a component needs in order to do its work. (In this example, we could have stored the state locally to the component, but, again, the étude you will write will have inter-dependent components.)  The <code>owner</code> is the React component that is behind the scenes.
  </p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn example [data owner]
  (reify
    om/IRender
    (render [_]
      (dom/div nil
        (dom/p nil "Your input here: "
          (dom/input #js{:type "text" :size "5" :value (:w @data))
        (dom/p nil "Square of number:" (* (:w @data) (:w @data)))))))</pre>
        
    <p>
    Unlike Quiescent, which uses an ordinary ClojureScript map for attributes, you must use a JavaScript object for the attributes; hence the leading <code>#js</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    That is the long form for defining a component. If you are going to simply render a component (rather than initialize it when it mounts, etc.) and you don’t need to access the owner, you can simplify the code with <code>om/component</code>.
    </p>
    
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn example [data owner]
  (om/component
      (dom/div nil
        (dom/p nil "Your input here: "
          (dom/input #js{:type "text" :size "5" :value (:w @data))
        (dom/p nil "Square of number:" (* (:w @data) (:w @data)))))))</pre>
    
    <p>
    Using the long form, here is how you would add code to initialize the input field to the minute of the current hour. It uses <code>om/transact!</code> which takes three arguments: the cursor, a key, and a function that returns the new value.
    </p>
    
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="clojurescript">(defn example [data owner]
  (reify
    <strong>om/IWillMount
    (will-mount [owner]
      (om/transact! data :n (fn [_] (.getMinutes (js/Date.)))))</strong>
    om/IRender
    (render [_]
      (dom/div nil
        (dom/p nil "Your input here: "
          (dom/input
            #js{:type "text" :size "5" :value (:n @data)}))
        (dom/p nil "Square of number:" (* (:n @data) (:n @data))))))</pre>
