  <h1>What’s an Étude?</h1>
  <p>
  An étude, according to Wikipedia, is “an instrumental musical composition, usually short and of considerable difficulty, usually designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill.”

  <h1>What are Études for ClojureScript?</h1>
  <p>
  In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can compose (write) in ClojureScript. The programs will
  usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular
  ClojureScript programming area. Unlike musical études, these programs have not been
  designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to
  stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find
  in most ClojureScript books or online references.
  </p>
  
  <p> 
  These études are not intended to introduce you to individual ClojureScript concepts. That ground is covered quite nicely by <a href="http://clojurescriptkoans.com/"><em>ClojureScript Koans</em></a>, <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/"><em>4Clojure</em></a>, and <a href="http://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/"><em>ClojureScript Unraveled</em></a>. Instead, these études take the form of small projects that do something that is (somewhat) useful. They are much along the lines of the programming katas given in chapter 10 of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do"><em>Living Clojure</em></a> by Carin Meier. If <em>Koans</em>, <em>4Clojure</em>, and <em>ClojureScript Unraveled</em> ask you to write programs at the level of chemical elements, in this book you are constructing simple molecules.

  <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
  <p>
  Thanks to Simon St. Laurent and Meghan Blanchette at O’Reilly Media, who encouraged me to write this book. Thanks also to all the people
  on the <code>#clojurescript</code> IRC channel, who patiently answered my questions.
